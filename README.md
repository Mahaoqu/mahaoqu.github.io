To start, install nodejs, npm and yarn first.

Then, install gatsby-cli and gh-pages globally. Also, we need to update the dependencies.

```bash
yarn global add gatsby-cli gh-pages
```

If the major version of Gatsby changed, followed the guide on Gastby's website. 
The simpliest way is to delete and re-generate all project by `gatsby new`.
But how about the old theme? I think we should update it by myself or find from the original author.

```bash


Then run the development server. It will open a browser window with the site.

```bash
gatsby develop
```

## UI 

- Material UI
- Typography theme
